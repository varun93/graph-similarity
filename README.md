# Finding Similarity across different News Content

This project is related to finding common news content across news channels.

We worked on a Cycle Detection algorithm in graphs to find common topics across news feeds. The algorithm involved modeling each news content as a node in a graph and the nodes belonging to different feeds would be connected by an edge, whose weight would depict the similarity between the two news contents, provided the weight is lesser than a threshold, set manually. My role was to implement the algorithm to calculate the Similarity Index between news items, which formed the basis for graph construction.
